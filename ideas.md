This is where I jot down ideas for posts that I don't have the time or knowledte to write yet.

### Manipulation vs. Participation

I've noticed a dichotomy that seems to be extremely prevalent in, well, pretty much
everything. The dichotomy is between manipulating a system and participating in it.

### Magic: The Gathering and Design

Magic: The Gathering (MTG) is a card game which involves both strategic playing and
strategic design. The strategic design comes from the deckbuilding portion of the game
where the player is tasked with taking the cards availible and creating a 60 (or more)
card deck with them. This deckbuilding process requires good design, and I belive it can
be useful as a tool to practice and understand design.

### The new becomes the old: why I have to find a new tech blog every two years

There's an annoying trend in tech blogs to start out really high quality and degrade to
low quality sensationalism over time. This happend with Gizmodo, Engadget, and now it's
happening with The Verge. The reasons for this are also illustrated nicely in the South
Park episode "Something Wal-Mart This Way Comes".

### The Pardox of Self

Much has been written about the true nature of the self over the years, probably because
it's really interesting and hard to explain.

### Sterling Archer and Wu Wei

Sterling Archer from the TV show is known for his situational awareness - his ability to
always know exactly where the bad guy is, how many shots have been fired, etc. I see this
level of situational awareness as related to the Taoist concept of Wu Wei - action without
action. The relation runs deeper than Archer's situational awareness - Archer is one of
the most Wu Wei characters I've ever seen.
