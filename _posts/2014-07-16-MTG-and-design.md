Magic: The Gathering (MTG) is a trading card game that involves both strategic play and
strategic design. I think it has some valuable lessons to teach about good design. The
design part of the game comes from how one constructs their deck, so I'll be focusing on
deckbuilding. There are also quite a few things to consider when designing a good deck (or
anything really), so I'm going to focus on just a couple in this article.

Like all design, the deck construction is a product of the
requirements - to beat other decks - so it's important to have at least a general
understanding of how the game is played. A game of Magic is played between two or more players who each have a 60+ card deck, and some
starting amount of life. There are many variations on the basic rules, as well as variations
on which cards one is allowed to use to build their deck. The goal is to win (obviously)
by reducing your opponent's life total to 0 or having your opponent draw a card when there
are no cards left in their deck. There are other ways to win (some cards let you win right
away if a certain condition is met), but those are the main 2. In order to win, one must
not only be lucky and skilled, but also have a coherently designed deck that *can* win.

‘concentration’. But for truth this needs to be amplified as the ‘concentration of
strength against weakness’. ~ B. H. Liddell Hart

Good deckbuilding is about creating a coherent, efficient, solution to the problem "how do
I win a game of magic". The deck is shuffled between each game, so it is impossible to
predict what cards one will have. Therefore, a deck will be more effective if all of the
cards work with each other card in the deck (or if each card is powerful enough on its
own, but I'll get to that later). This is called synergy. A synergistec deck wins
effectivly because it is more than the sum of its parts. For example, the card [Delver of
Secrets][1] is weak by itself, but in a deck built to take advantage of it, it's one of the
most powerful cards in the game.

The concept of synergy relates to the design principle of grouping similar elements. By
grouping similar elements in magic, one creates an effective deck because those elements
complement each other. This is true for design in general as well. Grouping similar
elements leads to coherent, beautiful design because similar elements compliment and
enhance one another. In interface design, for example, grouping similar elements leads to
a intuitive interface because it creates a pattern for the user to notice and follow - you
don't have to tell them where something is if they can guess. Magic teaches us to design
by looking for patterns and common elements, and placing them together.

 when there is nothing left to take away. ~ Antoine de Saint-Exupery

While grouping similar elements is important, it's even more important that they're
grouped with purpose. In magic, we see this in the concept of a win condition. A
win condition is basically the way your deck usually wins - your gameplan. For example, 
in a deck built around Delver of Secrets, the win condition is reducing the opponents
life to 0 by playing a early threat that is powerful enough to win on its own if unimpeded
(Delver of Secrets), and slowing down your opponent enough to win with it.
Since the deck is randomized (and you only get one card a turn, unless you play cards that
let you draw more), every card in the deck has to contribute to this plan. This gives us a
guideline to which elements to group together and why: we need cards that help us win with
Delver of Secrets. The more effective each card is at doing that (and working with the
other cards that do that), the easier it will be for us to win.

However, slowing down the opponent is not enough to be included in the deck. Some cards
are better in certain situations than others, and some cards are *only* useful in certain
situations. We want to avoid useless cards as much as possible (we call this a dead draw -
when you draw a card and it's "dead" or completly useless). That is to say, we want to
avoid extraneous elements as much as possible. This is a familiar design principle, stated
by Dieter Rams as "Good design is as little as possible". Less is better because it
focusses on only the essential aspects: we only want to put cards in our deck that will be
useful to us.

To sum up, good deckbuilding, like good design, requires focus and synergy between similar
elements. There are many more ways that good deckbuilding reflects good design, and I'll
be writing more about them as I understand them better.
eventually write posts about them.
