In an unabashed attempt to improve himself (and get a job) local man Paul O'Day put a website on the internet today. Sources close to O'Day stated that this was not his first attempt at blogging, but that he's "pretty sure" he can stick with it this time. O'Day himself realeased a statement saying "I'm going to kick off this blogstravaganza with something lighthearted and short - maybe I'll ape The Onion with a fake news story about something that nobody actually cares about".
