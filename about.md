This is my attempt to exist on the internet. Primarily a blog, but I also post my projects
and hopefully a podcast. I'm Paul O'Day, a 20 year old student from the greater Portalnd,
OR metro area, which is where I currently reside. I'm looking for a job in technology - if
you're intersted in a hard-working self-starting programmer/computer guy, let me know.
Computers aren't the only thing I'm interested in though; I also play a lot of Magic: The
Gathering, I swim, read, skate, and love the outdoors.
